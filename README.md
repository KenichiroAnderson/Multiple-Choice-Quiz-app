# Multiple-Choice-Quiz-app
Similar to a MC Style Quiz 

Pretty much tried to study for a quiz using Quizlet Learn mode which is essentially a Multiple choice quiz which shows you the definition and then shows you 4 possible answers. If you get an answer wrong it will put that question back into the quiz set until you get them all right which then you have essentially mastered the items.

Turns out Quizlet limits you to about 1-2 rounds of 10-15 questions which isn't helpful at all as I don't like paying for something so simple. 

This is a local host project. If you are looking for proper webpages and servers there are multiple apps similar to Quizlet Learn mode. I pretty much put this together in a couple of days when I really should have been studying and actually using the app.
